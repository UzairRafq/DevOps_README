## Dockerfile Keywords

> 1. FROM : It tells docker from which base image, you want to create your image from.
Usage : 
```bash
FROM <image>
FROM <image>:<tag>
```
> 2. RUN : This command is used to run the instructions against the image. 
Usage : 
```bash
RUN <command>
```
> 3. CMD : CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, both the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.
Note : Please note that there can only be one CMD in a Dockerfile.
Usage : 
```bash
CMD <command> <param1> <param2> (shell form)
```

> 4. MAINTAINER : It is used to specify the maintainer of the Dockerfile. In our case, we just specify the email id.
Usage : 
```bash
MAINTAINER <name>
```

> 5. ADD : Adds new files, directories, or remote file URLs from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.
Usage : 
 
```bash
ADD <src>  <dest>
```

> 6. ENTRYPOINT : Allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
Usage : 

```bash
ENTRYPOINT <command> <param1> <param2> (shell form)
```

> 7. ENV : The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.
Usage : 
 
```bash
ENV <key> <value>
```

> 8. EXPOSE : It Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port(s) at runtime.
Usage : 

```bash
EXPOSE <port> [<port> ...]
```

Usage : 
 
```bash
COPY <src> [<src> ...] <dest>
```

> 12. WORKDIR : Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it.
Usage : 

```bash

# Docker Mysql Container Connection :

https://phoenixnap.com/kb/mysql-docker-container

# Docker Networking : 

1. Every installation of the Docker Engine automatically includes three default networks. You can list them:

```
$ docker network ls

NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
18a2866682b8        none                null
c288470c46f6        host                host
7b369448dccb        bridge              bridge
```


2. The network named bridge is a special network. Unless you tell it otherwise, Docker always launches your containers in this network. Try this now:
```
$ docker run -itd --name=networktest ubuntu

74695c9cea6d9810718fddadc01a727a5dd3ce6a69d09752239736c030599741
```

3. Inspecting the network is an easy way to find out the containerâ€™s IP address.
```
$ docker network inspect bridge
```

4. You can remove a container from a network by disconnecting the container. To do this, you supply both the network name and the container name. You can also use the container ID. In this example, though, the name is faster.
```
$ docker network disconnect bridge networktest
```

While you can disconnect a container from a network, you cannot remove the builtin bridge network named bridge. Networks are natural ways to isolate containers from other containers or other networks. So, as you get more experienced with Docker, create your own networks.


## Create your own bridge network
```
$ docker network create -d bridge my_bridge
```
The -d flag tells Docker to use the bridge driver for the new network. You could have left this flag off as bridge is the default value for this flag.

Use the docker network rm command to remove a user-defined bridge network. If containers are currently connected to the network, disconnect them first.
```
$ docker network rm my_bridge
```

## Connect a container to a user-defined bridgeðŸ”—

When you create a new container, you can specify one or more --network flags. This example connects a Nginx container to the my-net network. It also publishes port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the Docker host, so external clients can access that port. Any other container connected to the my-net network has access to all ports on the my-nginx container, and vice versa.
```
$ docker create --name my-nginx \
  --network my-net \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  nginx:latest
  ```
To connect a running container to an existing user-defined bridge, use the docker network connect command. The following command connects an already-running my-nginx container to an already-existing my-net network:
```
$ docker network connect my-net my-nginx
```
To disconnect a running container from a user-defined bridge, use the docker network disconnect command. The following command disconnects the my-nginx container from the my-net network.
```
$ docker network disconnect my-net my-nginx
```


# Dockerizing a Node.js Project

# Steps 1 to Dockerize a Node.js Project

 # Create a Dockerfile:
Create a file named Dockerfile in the root directory of your Node.js project and add the following content:

# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json into the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]


# Step 2: Docker Image Build Karna
Using a Dockerfile, build an image.

 docker build -t my-node-app .

# Step 3: Running a Docker Container

Run The Docker Container

$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -d my-node-app

# Docker Compose for Node.js Project

# Create docker-compose.yml file

version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
    command: npm start

  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

volumes:

# Folder Structure for Node.js Project
Make sure that your project folder structure is correct:

go
Copy code
my-node-app/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â””â”€â”€ app.js
 
# Common Commands for Node.js Docker Setup
Dependencies update karna:

docker-compose run app npm install

Logs check karna:

In this way, you can easily Dockerize your Node.js project and use it for a multi-container setup with Docker Compose.


# Dockerizing a Python Project:

 If you have a Python project, you will need to create a Dockerfile to Dockerize it. Below is an example of how to Dockerize a Python application.

# Step 1: Creating the Dockerfile To Dockerize:

  Python application, you need to create a Dockerfile that sets up the Python environment and runs your code. For a simple Python project, the Dockerfile will look something like this:

  # Base image select karein
FROM python:3.9-slim

# App directory create karein

WORKDIR /app

# Required dependencies ko install karne ke liye requirements.txt file ko copy karein
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Python dependencies install karein

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Application ka code copy karein
COPY . .

# Port expose karein (Agar aapka app kisi specific port pe listen kar raha ho)
EXPOSE 5000

# Default command set karein
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# Step 2: Create a Requirements

 File You will need to specify the dependencies of your Python project in a requirements.txt file, such as:

 Flask==2.0.1
requests==2.25.1

# Step 3: Build Docker Image
Build an image using this Dockerfile.

docker build -t my-python-app .

# Step 4: Run Docker Container

docker run -p 5000:5000 -d my-python-app

# Docker Compose for Python Project

# Create docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/__pycache__
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

volumes:
  postgres_data:


 # Docker Compose Commands

 1. Build and Run

   $ docker-compose up --build

 2. Container Stop Command

   $ docker-compose down

# Folder Structure for Python Project

Make sure that your project folder structure is correct:

my-python-app/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ __init__.py

# Common Commands for Python Docker Setup
